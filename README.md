# Testing for Scalability and Reliability in API Systems

## Overview

In modern distributed systems and cloud-native environments, scalability and reliability are not optional — they are baseline requirements. Systems that perform well under low traffic might behave dramatically differently under high load, and small inefficiencies can snowball into severe bottlenecks.

This document demonstrates how **performance testing** and **benchmarking** help validate implementation choices that can significantly impact system scalability. We use a simple yet illustrative case study — different implementations of the Fibonacci number generator — to measure how architectural decisions affect performance.

## Why Performance and Scalability Testing Matter

While **unit testing** ensures correctness and **integration testing** verifies system interactions, **performance testing** focuses on:

- Response time under load
- Resource consumption (CPU, memory)
- Throughput consistency under various conditions

These aspects determine whether your system will scale gracefully, fail under pressure, or consume cloud resources inefficiently.

## Case Study: Fibonacci Implementations

We implemented two versions of a Fibonacci number generator in C#:

1. **Recursive** – a naïve implementation with exponential time complexity (O(2ⁿ)).
2. **Linear** – an optimized iterative implementation with linear time complexity (O(n)).

Each implementation was exposed via an ASP.NET Core Web API, and tested using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/) — a powerful benchmarking library.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /fibonacci/recursive/{n}`
- `GET /fibonacci/linear/{n}`

## Benchmark Setup

- **Machine:** Apple M2, macOS Sequoia 15.6 (8 cores)
- **.NET Version:** 9.0.0
- **Tool:** BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.2
- **Method:** 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 were used as test values for `n`.

## Benchmark Results Summary

| Method    | n  | Mean Time         | Std Dev           | Allocated Memory |
|-----------|----|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Recursive | 10 | 141.70 ns         | 0.17 ns           | 0 B              |
| Linear    | 10 | **3.39 ns**       | 0.01 ns           | 0 B              |
| Recursive | 20 | 17,577.80 ns      | 39.05 ns          | 0 B              |
| Linear    | 20 | **6.35 ns**       | 0.03 ns           | 0 B              |
| Recursive | 30 | 2,088,181.30 ns   | 1,098.63 ns       | 0 B              |
| Linear    | 30 | **9.17 ns**       | 0.04 ns           | 0 B              |
| Recursive | 40 | 265,533,995.54 ns | 227,362.62 ns     | 0 B              |
| Linear    | 40 | **12.19 ns**      | 0.15 ns           | 0 B              |
| Recursive | 50 | 31,670,989,147 ns | 48,389,845.69 ns  | 0 B              |
| Linear    | 50 | **16.72 ns**      | 0.25 ns           | 0 B              |

**Key takeaway:** the recursive version becomes exponentially slower with increasing `n`, while the linear version remains extremely efficient.

## Practical Implications

1. **Exponential Complexity Doesn't Scale**  
   The recursive implementation is easy to write but **non-viable** for large input sizes. A simple recursive call that works for `n=10` explodes to over 30 seconds at `n=50`.

2. **Micro-optimizations Matter in Scale**  
   The linear implementation remains **consistently performant** and is production-grade. Even nanosecond-level savings can add up across millions of requests.

3. **Test in Context**  
   Benchmarking on developer machines is useful for initial validation, but production-like environments are better for high-fidelity results.

4. **Reliability Testing Complements Performance**  
   In real-world systems, use tools like:
   - **k6**, **JMeter**, or **Locust** for load testing
   - **Polly** or **Chaos Monkey** for resilience testing
   - **Health probes** and **observability tools** for runtime diagnostics

| Integration Tests| Validate interactions between services         | TestServer, WebApplicationFactory |
| Performance Tests| Measure throughput and response time           | BenchmarkDotNet, k6           |
| Load Testing     | Observe system behavior under concurrent load  | Locust, JMeter, Artillery     |
| Stress Testing   | Identify failure thresholds                    | Gatling, k6                   |
| Chaos Testing    | Test reliability under failure scenarios       | ChaosToolkit, Gremlin         |

## Recommendations

- **Benchmark before you scale**: Know how your system behaves under stress before deploying to production.
- **Automate testing**: Include performance benchmarks in your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Profile often**: Combine benchmarks with profilers (dotTrace, PerfView, etc.) for bottleneck discovery.
- **Keep it simple**: Even trivial examples like Fibonacci can reveal real-world lessons.
